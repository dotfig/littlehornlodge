      <h2>Welcome to Little Horn Lodge</h2>
      <p><em>“God's great outdoors... to some it may be an escape, a refuge, a sanctuary; others may call it an adventure or a get-away. To me, it's an indescribable moment, an unforgettable opportunity, a privilege, and a true passion!” -Rob Newton</em></p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>We are excited that you could visit! The original building was built in 1961, with two additions to follow. Newly-established in November of 2011, and after much exterior labor and interior remodeling, Little Horn Lodge has become the escape longed for by many. Those who have experienced its many amenities, along with the countless blessings that surround it in God’s great outdoors have each gained a new perspective on what life truly should be like every day. Little Horn Lodge is a work in progress and you are a very important part of what it will become. A new metal roof was put on in 2013. New vinyl siding was completed in July of 2016. We hope that you too will have a life-changing encounter while visiting Little Horn Lodge. Turn off the cell phone, make yourself comfy, respect the outdoors, above all be safe and have a great time while visiting!</p>

            <p>You are only a few short miles from one of Pennsylvania’s most precious waterways. The Clarion River spans 132 miles beginning in Johnsonburg (Elk County), and flowing through, in, and around the many mountains in its path to the Allegheny River just south of Emlenton, PA. The river provides many activity offerings such as swimming, fishing, bathing, canoeing, kayaking, or other types of float rafting</p>
            <p>Little Horn Lodge currently owns and operates two kayaks, but there are many canoe/kayak outfitters just waiting for help you experience a great day along the river. Clear spring water also makes for some excellent fishing. Many trophy-sized trout are known to have been taken south of Johnsonburg to Portland Mills, but excellent fishing throughout!</p>

            <p>Located only 25-30 minutes away, in Marienville, PA (the gateway to the Allegheny National Forest, which offers over 500,000 natural acres.) Buzzard Swamp is #1 on the Little Horn Lodge owner’s ‘Top 3’ destinations. Experience nature at an even greater level!! Hiking Trails offer excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. Most of the trails are not marked with diamonds, so watch the informational signs for directions. The skill level of the trails is easy and the terrain is relatively flat.</p>
            <p>Some of the trails are located within meadows with little protection from the sun and wind. Buzzard Swamp offers some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities on the Forest. The area is an important link in the Atlantic flyway during the waterfowl migration. During spring migration, 20-25 species of waterfowl can be seen around the swamp. An observant hiker could see bear, deer, beaver, coyote, snapping turtles, turkey, osprey and bald eagles. Don't forget your binoculars for great views of the native fauna. All of the ponds have small and large-mouth bass, perch, catfish, crappie, and bluegill.</p>
            <p>Boating is permitted on the ponds, but no motors are allowed. The nearest pond is a 1 mile trek from the trailhead, and since no motorized vehicles are allowed within the swamp, boats must be carried. Bikes are welcomed. Due to the long walk, the ponds are only fished by those willing to make the trek… but oh it is worth it! 15 ponds (I challenge you to find them all), excellent Large Mouth Bass fishing! - Did someone say snakes…? Well you best be on alert as this area is also home to the Timber Rattler, the Copperhead, and many other snake species. – Do not fear them, leave them be, slowly retreat and select another route. – Never knowingly approach a venomous snake.</p>

            <p>Located just outside the Clear Creek State Park – only 25 minutes of beautiful driving, BearTown Rocks is a popular area attraction, especially for park visitors. It offers a great view of wildlife and plant life, but the main attraction is the collection of enormous rocks and rock/tree formations. When you arrive at the BearTown parking area, you can take the trail to the left, or explore all the glacier-created, house-sized rock arrangements and start hiking and looking for colorful mossy growth, weathered crevices, pockmarks, and great forest vantage points. A few trails in the area range from moderate to difficult terrain.  The Trap Run loop, and BearTown Rocks trails are beautiful, and should be on the list of activities to enjoy if visiting the Rocks area. This is also the location of many years of great memories of big game hunting by little Horn Lodge owners, dating back to 1979.</p>

            <p><strong>Clear Creek State Park</strong> is only 15-20 minutes away, near BearTown Rocks and encompasses 1,444 acres in Jefferson County. The park occupies a scenic portion of the Clear Creek Valley from PA 949 to the Clarion River. Over 25 miles or hiking trails, swimming, canoeing, lounging, &amp; more!  </p>
            <p><strong>Forest State Park</strong> - The 8,500-acre Cook Forest State Park lies in scenic northwestern Pennsylvania. Once called the “Black Forest,” the area is famous for its stands of old growth forest. Cook Forest’s “Forest Cathedral” of towering white pines and hemlocks is a National Natural Landmark. The Clarion River connects Clear Creek State Park to Cook Forest State Park along a scenic 10- mile stretch of river which is popular for canoeing and rafting. Many activities in the this area, located within 30 minutes of Little Horn Lodge.</p>
            <p><strong>Bendigo State Park</strong> is nearby, in Johnsonburg (35-40 min drive). The 100-acre park is in a small valley surrounded by picturesque hills. About 20 acres of the park is developed, half of which is a large, shaded picnic area. The forest is predominantly northern hardwoods and includes beech, birch, cherry and maple. The East Branch of the Clarion River flows through the park. This  waterway was once polluted by abandoned mine drainage. It now provides excellent fishing and is stocked with trout by the PA Fish and Boat Commission. </p>

A trip that you’ll surely be talking about and sharing with other for years to come. Large tracks have been found in the SGL 54 behind Little Horn Lodge, so they may not be all that far away us after all!</p>
